# wsitools utilities roadmap

Tracks the full set of CLI utilities planned for wsitools, organised
into "shipped" and "planned" sections. The shipped section is updated
as releases land; the planned section is the source of truth for what's
queued, deferred, or under consideration.

## Shipped

### v0.1
- `downsample` — produce a lower-magnification SVS by an integer power-of-2 factor.
- `doctor` — list registered codecs + cgo deps.
- `version` — print version + Go runtime info.

### v0.2
- `transcode` — re-encode pyramid tiles in a different codec (jpeg, jpegxl, avif, webp, htj2k); 6 sane source formats; streaming pipeline.

### v0.3
- (no new utilities — opentile-go v0.14 migration milestone; novel-codec round-trip + sync.Pool + TileInto adoption).

### v0.4
- `info` — slide summary (openslide-show-properties analog).
- `dump-ifds` — format-aware per-IFD layout dump (slim tiffinfo analog).
- `extract` — save associated image (label/macro/thumbnail/overview) as PNG or JPEG.
- `hash` — content hash (file mode default; pixel mode opt-in).

## Planned

### Batch 2 — extends batch 1
- **`region`** — openslide-write-png analog: extract `--x --y --w --h --level` rectangle as PNG. Requires tile decode + stitching across boundaries.
- **`dump-tile`** — single tile's compressed bytes to file or stdout. Pure debug aid.
- **`dump-ifds --raw`** — full tiffinfo-style tag dump per IFD; expansion of v0.4's slim dump-ifds.

### Batch 3 — operations
- **`tagset`** — in-place TIFF tag edit (e.g. ImageDescription, Software). Useful for fixing one bad slide in a pool without full re-encode.
- **`inventory`** — walk a directory; dump CSV/JSON of slide metadata for pool-management UIs.
- **`verify`** — open every IFD, decode every tile, report errors. "fsck for WSI."
- **`diff`** — compare two slides (pixel diff, metadata diff, IFD ordering diff).

### Larger items
- **`dzsave`** — DeepZoom pyramid generator; OpenSeadragon-compatible tile tree. Analog of libvips `dzsave` and openslide-python `deepzoom_tile.py`.
- **`tile-server`** — HTTP DZI/IIIF tile server; analog of openslide-python `deepzoom_server.py`. Activates opentile-go v0.13's splice-prefix optimization (TilePrefix / TileBodyInto / SpliceJPEGTile).
- **`dicom-wsi`** — convert WSI to DICOM-WSI format. Analog of `wsi2dcm` (highdicom) and `wsidicomizer`.

## Codecs (write-side, separate from utilities)

### Deferred from v0.2
- `jpegli` — blocked on Homebrew libjxl shipping libjpegli OR build-from-source.
- `HEIF`, `JPEG-LS`, `JPEG-XR`, `Basis Universal` — queued.
- `jpeg2000` as a transcode-encoder target — decoder shipped; encoder wrapper queued.

## Source format support

### Deferred from v0.2
- Leica SCN — multi-image / multi-channel pipeline plumbing.

## Architectural

### Deferred from v0.2
- Streaming retrofit for `downsample` — currently materialises full L0 raster.

### Deferred from v0.3
- TilePrefix / TileBodyInto / SpliceJPEGTile adoption — only valuable if `tile-server` is built.

## Quality gates

### Deferred from v0.2
- Visual-fidelity tests via mini decoders — decode v0.2 codec outputs through matching codec library; pixel-compare against source.
